(a) Setup of the system. Larvae in liquid phase of ultra-low gelling temperature agarose hydrogel are automatically loaded from a reservoir into the system with a microfluidic component, and arrayed onto a surface-treated plate as single larva-containing hydrogel droplets. Both the loading reservoir and arraying plates are placed on motorized X–Y stages, and the loading and dispensing nozzles are mounted on motorized Z stages. Depending on the desired orientation, the larvae are either agitated with a vibrating motor attached to the plate (for dorsal-up orientation) or anesthetized prior to loading (for lateral orientation). Larvae are immobilized by cooling with a thermoelectric cooler to rapidly solidify the hydrogel droplets. The system automatically identifies each larva, positions the targeted region under the injectionmicropipette, and detects the contact and penetration of the tip of the micropipette. A computer-controlled pressure driven microinjector is then triggered to inject test compounds into the target organ. After injection, a self-adhesive bottomless multi-well chamber is attached to the plate and the larvae are recovered from the hydrogel by gently flushing each droplet with embryo medium.
